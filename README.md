Analog2.0 is a modular system synthesizer designed to be easy to make even for first-time users.

This repository contains the following resources to assist in the production of Analog2.0:

- Schematic image file
- Board layout file
- Artwork files such as panels
- Firmware and source code

We also have a production guide on the Wiki page of this repository.

Analog2.0 consists of the following major modules. In this repository, there is a directory for each module, and resources for making the module are placed under each directory.

- `02_panel` panel
- `03_power` Power supply module
- `04_noise_mixer` Noise generator and mixer
- `05_vca VCA` --Voltage Control Amplifier
- `06_vco VCO` --Voltage Controlled Oscillator
- `07_eg` Envelope Generator
- `08_lfo` LFO --Low frequency oscillator
- `09_vcf` VCF --Voltage control filter
- `10_miniboard MIDI` / CV converter

For reference, there is something in the others directory that does not conform to the Analog2.0 system but can be used as a synthesizer module.

- Ring modulator
- Graphic equalizer
- Resonator
- Phase shifter
- Gate delay
- Analog sequencer

The documentation for each module is not currently maintained. The latest document is published as the book "Introduction to Self-made Analog Synthesizers Made with Masters Revised Edition 2017".
