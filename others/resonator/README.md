#Resonator

## Overview

Resonator means "resonator". This is a filter that adds a peak of frequency characteristics to the input signal. It generally has fewer bands than a graphic equalizer, but instead allows finer adjustments to the center frequency and resonance sharpness of the filter. These filters are well suited to produce effects similar to instrument-specific resonances and other phenomena, allowing you to create sounds that resemble voice or make instrument sounds more authentic. This resonator has 3 filters.
