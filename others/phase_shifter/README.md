#Phase shifter

## Overview

Phase shifters are better known as effectors rather than synthesizer modules. It seems that it was originally devised to get a sound similar to the effect of a rotating speaker, but in fact it is not very similar. Even so, it is an effector that is useful because it has a unique and interesting effect that makes the sound swell. The circuit diagram is as shown on the next page.
